## Installation

To get started with the Basic JavaScript Programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/mmabiaa/Basic-JavaScript-Programs.git`


2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Basic-JavaScript-Programs`


3. Open the HTML files in your preferred web browser or use a code editor with a live server extension.

## Usage

Each program is contained within its own file. You can run any of the JavaScript files by including them in an HTML document or executing them in a JavaScript console. Hereâ€™s how you can include a JavaScript file in an HTML document:
```
<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <title>JavaScript Program</title> <script src="path/to/your/javascript-file.js"></script> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to My JavaScript Program</h1> </body> </html>
```
## Examples
Here are a few examples of what you can find in this repository:

Hello World: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
```
console.log("Hello, World!");
Factorial Calculation: A function that calculates the factorial of a number.
text
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

Array Manipulation: Demonstrating how to add, remove, and iterate through arrays.
```
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
fruits.push('grape'); // Add an element
fruits.splice(1, 1); // Remove 'banana'

fruits.forEach(fruit => {
    console.log(fruit);
});
```
